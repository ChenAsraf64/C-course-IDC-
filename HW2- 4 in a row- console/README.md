# 🎮 4 in a Row - Console Version

## 📌 About  
This project is a **console-based C# implementation** of the classic game **4 in a Row (Connect Four)**. It features both a **two-player mode** and a **single-player mode against an AI opponent**. The game includes board rendering in the console, win condition detection, and an AI that makes strategic moves. The project applies **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles**, including encapsulation, modular design, and class hierarchies, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **C#** – Core programming language  
- **.NET** – Framework for development  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Encapsulation, modularity and separation of concerns  
- **AI Logic** – Basic algorithm for computer opponent decision-making  
- **Exception Handling** – For handling invalid inputs and unexpected scenarios  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Single-Player Mode** – Play against an AI opponent with strategic moves  
- **Two-Player Mode** – Play locally against another person  
- **Win Condition Detection** – Recognizes horizontal, vertical and diagonal wins  
- **Dynamic Console Rendering** – Updates the game board after each move  
- **Input Validation** – Ensures valid column selection and prevents errors  
- **Object-Oriented Design** – Structured game logic for maintainability  

## 📖 How to Play  
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ChenAsraf64/C-sharp-course-IDC.git` Open the project in **Visual Studio**. Build and run the **4 in a Row - Console** project. Choose between **Single-Player** (against AI) or **Two-Player** mode. Players take turns entering a column number to drop their piece. The game announces the winner once four pieces align in a row.
