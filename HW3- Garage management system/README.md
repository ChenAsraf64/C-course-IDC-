- **.NET** – Framework for development  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Encapsulation, polymorphism and class hierarchies  
- **Design Patterns** – Applied to ensure modularity and maintainability  
- **Exception Handling** – For robust error management  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Vehicle Management** – Add, remove and update vehicle information  
- **Service Tracking** – Assign repair services and update their status  
- **Billing System** – Calculate and display charges for completed services  
- **Polymorphism & Class Hierarchy** – Supports multiple vehicle types (e.g., cars, motorcycles, trucks)  
- **User-Friendly Console Interface** – Command-based system for smooth interaction
